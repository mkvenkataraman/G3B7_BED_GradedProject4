-- The `schema.sql` file initializes the database schema on startup.
-- It defines tables, views, and other database objects, ensuring
-- consistency across environments and simplifying setup. Useful for
-- development and testing, it's automatically executed by Spring Boot
-- if `spring.sql.init.mode` is set.
